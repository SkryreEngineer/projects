Goals for the job tracker program:
    1. Create a job class for general use in the program.
    2. Create a list of jobs that the user has applied for that can be added to.
    3. Make the list editable so that the user can update submitted applications with a result.
Nice to have extra goals:
    A. Let the user sort the list of jobs in different ways (company name, date submitted, etc.)
    B. Add an option to export the job list as an excel sheet.
    C. Be able to import an excel sheet for the job list?
